👨‍🎓 Face Attendance System
This project is a Python-based Face Attendance System that uses Dlib and OpenCV to detect and recognize students' faces in real-time via a webcam. Once a face is detected and matched against known student images, their attendance is marked as present.

🧠 How It Works
    Load Student Images: All images in the students/ directory are read and encoded using Dlib’s face recognition model.
    Start Webcam: The system captures live video using OpenCV.
    Click to Scan: Click on the OpenCV window to trigger a scan.
    Face Recognition: The face from the webcam frame is encoded and compared with known student encodings.
    Attendance Marking: If a match is found and not previously marked, the student's name is printed as present.
    Absent Students: After the session ends, students not recognized are considered absent.

🛠 Requirements
    Python 3.x
    Dlib
    OpenCV
    NumPy

🐍 Install Dependencies

    pip install dlib opencv-python numpy

⚠️ Dlib requires CMake and Boost libraries to be installed for Windows. It is recommended to install it via pre-built wheels or Anaconda if compilation fails.

📸 Preparing Student Images
    Save each student's image in the students/ directory.
    The filename (without extension) will be used as the student’s name.

    Example:
      john_doe.jpg → Recognized as "john_doe"

▶️ How to Run
    python face_attendance.py

    A window named "Face Attendance System" will open.
    Click anywhere inside the window to trigger a face scan.

    If the face matches a known student:
        Their name will be printed in the console as present.

    If not recognized:
        Console will show "not a student".

    If no face is detected:
        Console will show "No face detected in the scanned photo."

⏹ Ending the Program
    Press ESC key to stop the webcam and close the attendance session.
    After exiting, all students who were not marked present will be stored in a global list named absent_students.

✅ Features
    Face detection and recognition using Dlib
    Real-time video scanning with OpenCV
    Tolerant face comparison with adjustable threshold
    Easy attendance marking by matching file names
    One-click face scan trigger using mouse callback

⚙️ Configuration
      Tolerance Level: 
            Default is 0.6. You can adjust the sensitivity of matching by changing the tolerance parameter in compare_faces().
            def compare_faces(encoding1, encoding2, tolerance=0.6):

📌 Notes
    Make sure lighting conditions are sufficient for proper face detection.
    Student images should be clear and preferably front-facing.
    Currently, the system only detects one face at a time (the first detected face).
